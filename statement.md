# Problem Statement

Most educational institutions have a very inefficient and fragmented grievance redressal process, which is still dependent on paper forms or, in most cases, informal channels like email and verbal communication. This, therefore, brings about data loss, lack of transparency, and accountability, as well as the inability to track or resolve similar complaints from students. Students rarely know the status of their submission, while administrators face difficulties with manual records and reports.​

# Overview of the Project

The project deals with grievance management for college campuses by providing a unified desktop application built in Java. EduGrievance digitizes the entire lifecycle of a student grievance, from structured submission and real-time tracking to resolution and reporting. It is designed for standalone use without the need for external database or network dependencies, thus making it suitable for offline, resource-constrained environments. The architecture supports further enhancements, such as database migration and sending email notifications. ​
